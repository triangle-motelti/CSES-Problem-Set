Description:

You are given an array of n integers. Your goal is to modify the array so that it is increasing, meaning each element is at least as large as the previous element. 
In each move, you can increase any element's value by one. Find the minimum number of moves required.

Input:
The first input line contains an integer n: the size of the array.
The second line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n: the contents of the array.

Output:
Print the minimum number of moves.

Constraints:
* 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5
* 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9

Example:

Input:
5
3 2 5 1 7

Output:
5
