Description:

Consider an algorithm that processes a positive integer n as follows: if n is even, divide it by 2; if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
Repeat this process until n reaches 1. 

For instance, starting with n=3 produces this sequence:

3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
Your task is to simulate this algorithm for a provided n and output the entire sequence.
Input:

A single line with the integer n.
Output:

A single line containing all values in the sequence, separated by spaces.
Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6
Example:

Input:

3
Output:

3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
